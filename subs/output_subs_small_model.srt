1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:27,230
Hey, honey. How are you? What's going on? That was lunch. It was awesome. Yeah. Yeah, the girls got crazy today.

2
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:36,220
Yeah. I might have gotten a little crazy, too, but we won't talk about that. Yeah. They have a liquid lunch.

3
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:49,300
Usually. Yeah. You girls are. You went to one of those one time, remember? You had a blast, right? Yeah.

4
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:59,030
Hangin' out with us old ladies? I did. Gotta hold you guys back, though.

5
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,100
You can't drink as much as us. Probably not.

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:19,880
You should have seen Tracy dancing. Like no one else was dancing, just her.

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:30,540
That's pretty exciting. What's wrong?

8
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:50,370
Oh, shoulders always do. This is what I do for work now, Mom. Honey. Yeah, you're super tight. You gonna let me give you a massage yet?

9
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:58,560
You don't need to give me a massage. That's my job. That's what I'm doing. I know it's your job. I have a table set up in bags still, right now.

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,870
Yeah, but you make money doing that. Yeah, and you're my mom. I can give you a massage for free. You want me to pay me?

11
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:15,680
A little uncomfortable, you know? Why? Because it's just a little weird.

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not easy. Just let me give you a massage. You're gonna feel so much better afterwards. It's not weird.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,940
I mean, alright, I'll do it, but I can't get naked and stuff.

14
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:41,740
You learned. You have a sheet. I do this for a quick. It's my job now. It's not weird. You have a sheet. It's not a big deal.

15
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:56,900
Can I just keep my shorts on? I mean, not really. It's just, you're gonna be covered up. Trust me, it's fine.

16
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,410
If I let you do it, you'll stop bothering me about it? Yes. You need one. You're gonna be thanking me after we do it.

17
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:12,530
You're gonna be asking me for one every other day and I'll cut you back to two weeks. Just let me do it. Come on.

18
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,530
Alright. Where do we go?

19
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:25,060
See, I told you.

20
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,060
Okay. I'm proud of you. You've got it all done up and stuff.

21
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,060
Yeah, I moved the furniture all the way in.

22
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,060
This is nice.

23
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
I told you.

24
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
You're like professional and stuff.

25
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah.

26
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,700
Alright.

27
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,060
Here.

28
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
So what do I do?

29
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,950
Okay.

30
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
That's your sheet.

31
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,950
Yeah.

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,950
I mean, you just change right in there.

33
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:52,140
Right.

34
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,140
Yeah, everything, mom.

35
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,840
And that's when you have the sheet.

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,430
It's not weird.

37
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,430
I'm not. I'm just gonna wait for you to relax.

38
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:46,930
I'm gonna peek.

39
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,930
So just like put this all the way around?

40
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,120
Yeah.

41
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,640
Just relax.

42
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Don't worry. I'm gonna help you relax.

43
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,220
Yeah.

44
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Jump on the table.

45
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:27,150
So is this like bad if I'm getting a massage like after I've had wine and stuff?

46
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,180
No, that should probably help a little bit.

47
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,980
Right.

48
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Now what?

49
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Okay.

50
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
Jump on the table.

51
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Where?

52
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,980
Like head facing that way.

53
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,240
It's not rocket science.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Come on.

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Stop making fun of me.

56
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm not.

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Sorry.

58
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,020
Yeah.

59
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:27,940
It's not easy for me to do, you know.

60
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
I was playing tennis the other day.

61
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,940
I don't know what it did to my shoulder and my arm.

62
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:41,840
How much wine did you have?

63
00:06:41,840 --> 00:07:12,260
Just messing with you.

64
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,460
It's okay.

65
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,230
It's okay.

66
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,230
Just supposed to be a relaxing thing.

67
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,230
Yes.

68
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:58,740
Do you keep busy?

69
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
How many clients do you see in here?

70
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,460
As I can.

71
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,910
About two a day at least.

72
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,040
Sometimes more than that.

73
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:29,080
You know, you're gonna like undo this like rep or anything?

74
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah.

75
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah, just have it.

76
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,559
Honey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

77
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,659
Relax, relax.

78
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,960
Just got a tail.

79
00:08:39,890 --> 00:09:30,980
Okay, so it does feel pretty good.

80
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:40,140
What's that you're using?

81
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,100
I just don't know.

82
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Don't see what I haven't.

83
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,580
You let me do this before?

84
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,090
Because your friend might see your butt.

85
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,090
Because it's weird.

86
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,090
It's not weird.

87
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,950
I don't see what I want to wear you out, honey.

88
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,950
What did you do for a living?

89
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,950
What did you say?

90
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,950
Make your money.

91
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,950
I don't like doing that.

92
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:32,360
Your legs too, okay?

93
00:10:32,360 --> 00:11:08,020
They're always sore.

94
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Do you do those too?

95
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
I do.

96
00:11:10,020 --> 00:12:28,120
How many times do you think you've told me that so far?

97
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't know.

98
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,080
What?

99
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Are you saying I'm bad at relaxing?

100
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I'm just saying, wait, yeah.

101
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,140
All right, all right.

102
00:12:37,140 --> 00:13:37,600
Relax.

103
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,860
Am I relaxing better now?

104
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

105
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,860
It's still coming up, relax.

106
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,710
What's the matter, honey?

107
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:16,540
It stopped.

108
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Just close your eyes.

109
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:27,630
I don't know.

110
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:37,690
It feels good, right?

111
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:57,250
Yeah, pretty good at this.

112
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:13,930
It's sore right there.

113
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:31,250
Yeah.

114
00:15:31,250 --> 00:16:45,580
Is that what you're supposed to massage?

115
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Yeah.

116
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,370
I'm just kidding.

117
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,010
You are?

118
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm probably.

119
00:17:08,520 --> 00:20:18,110
Is this the way you touch all your clients?
